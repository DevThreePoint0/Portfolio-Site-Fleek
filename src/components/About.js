            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My strongest attributes are my hard work ethic and my professional respectful attitude in the workplace. I don't believe in cutting corners or taking the easy way out. I show my hard working skills by being punctual and attentive to detail, always making sure the work I'm doing is done correctly before I've finished my shift. It is very important to me that I treat others I work with such as customers or co-workers with full respect. I have a natural drive to problem solve, I'm not afraid of learning and working on new things.
